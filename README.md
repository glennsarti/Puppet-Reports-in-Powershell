Puppet-Reports-in-Powershell
============================

Powershell scripts to convert Puppet reports into other formats e.g. HTML or Teamcity Unit Tests

What's it for?
--------------
The [Puppet report YAML Puppet Report Format](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3/reference/format_report.html) can be very confusing to read when searching for a particular resource or when to get an overview of puppet run.
Puppet Enterprise does have a dashboard for this kind of investigation but when in running masterless this feature is not available.
